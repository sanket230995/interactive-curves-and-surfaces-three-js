### A Design Challenge: The Need for CAGD

When creating products and artwork, designers face tasks such as this:  You are given two points in a plane and two directions associated with the points.  Find the curve that passes through the points that is tangent to the given directions.

This is a simple pencil-and-paper task for anyone who is familiar with parametric forms, the types of curves used in CAGD.

CAGD tools are meant to be

* intuitive
* simple to use

Sometimes the mathematics underlying the tools becomes quite sophisticated, yet the result is meant to be easily understood and geometrically intuitive.

The technical person often benefits from these intuitive and visually related tools when considering deeper mathematical problems.  The geometry of CAGD is very amenable to visual demonstration.
