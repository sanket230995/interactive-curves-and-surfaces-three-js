* about some typical applications of CAGD tools.





### Exercise 1.1

We will be using JavaScript for our exercises.  In particular, we will be using the JavaScript embedded in browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

When embedded in a browser, JavaScript gets a whole range of APIs, including WebGL.  But we won't be using WebGL directly (at least not at first), because it is too low-level for most of what we want to do.  Instead we'll be using a wonderful JavaScript 3D API built on top of WebGL.  This JavaScript 3D API is called [**three.js**](https://threejs.org/).

You can find the latest version of three.js at https://threejs.org .

CAUTION:  For our exercises, we'll be using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) version r124, and NOT the latest available from the website.  This is because [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is still evolving rapidly, and the API changes over time.  This is okay, however, because you'll learn that JavaScript developers tend to be very conscious of the version numbers the APIs they use, because [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is not the only JavaScript API that is evolving quickly; in fact, most JavaScript APIs are evolving quickly.

Thankfully, because [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is open source, ALL prior versions are available in its git repository.

1. Navigate to the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) website and explore some of the projects in the gallery there.  

2. Pick one that appeals to you and show it to your tutor.  

3. Show your tutor what specifically impresses you about it.

4. See if you find the version number of the latest version of [three.js](https://threejs.org/).  Show your tutor
