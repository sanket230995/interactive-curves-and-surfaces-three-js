### What CAGD is All About

Computer-aided geometric design (CAGD) is a field that initially developed to bring the advantages of computers to industries such as

* automotive
* aerospace
* shipbuilding

CAGD expanded rapidly and now pervades many areas, from pharmaceutical design to animation.  We are surrounded by products that were first visualized on a computer.  These products were modified and refined entirely with the computer; when the product entered production, the tools and dies were produced directly from the geometry stored in the computer.  This process is known as *virtual prototyping*.

Computer visualizations of new products reduce the design cycle by easing the process of design modification and tool production

CAGD is based on the creation of curves and surfaces and is accurately described as curve and surface modeling.  Using CAGD tools with elaborate user interfaces, designers create and refine their ideas to produce complex results.  They combine large numbers of curve and surface segments to realize their ideas.  However the individual segments they use are relatively simple, and it is at this level that the study of CAGD is concentrated.



Modern JavaScript-in-a-browser-development requires that we know a few things about the developer capabilities built into our browsers.  We'll focus on Chrome in these tutorials, although Edge and Firefox have nearly the same developer capabilities.

### Exercise 1.2 ###

Launch Chrome, and press the F12 key.  You see a panel open in your browser.  This panel contains the developer tools.

1) Explore the tabs, and search the Internet to get an idea what each one means.  Show a couple to your tutor.
2) Navigate to the Elements tab.  Notice that you see HTML code.  Find and take a short HTML tutorial from the Internet so you can answer simple questions about the HTML code you see.  Show your tutor what site you chose, and tell your tutor why you chose that site.
3) Show what you have learned about HTML to your tutor.
