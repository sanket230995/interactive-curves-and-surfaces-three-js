### Types of Parametric Functions: 2D Polynomial Functions in Power Series Form

Remember that Power Series Form polynomials may be written like this? 

$$P_n(t)=a_0+a_1t+a_2t^2+a_3t^3+...+a_nt^n\tag{2.8a}$$

Since $P$ is just a name and since we are allowed to name things whatever we please, we could just as well write $2.8a$ like this:

​	$$x_n(t)=a_0+a_1t+a_2t^2+a_3t^3+...+a_nt^n\tag{2.8b}$$

In other words, we can use the letter $x$ instead of $P$.  In fact, we could just as easily write the equation using $y$ instead of $x$, and using $b$ instead of $a$, thus:

​	$$y_n(t)=b_0+b_1t+b_2t^2+b_3t^3+...+b_nt^n\tag{2.8c}$$

If we use $2.8b$ and $2.8c$ at the same time, we have a way to compute any point $(x, y)$ as a function of $t$.  In other words, we can use two (different) 1D polynomial functions to represent a single 2D polynomial function.

And we can do this for 3D, 4D, 5D, ... up to any number of dimensions.

There's a shorthand for writing an n-dimensional polynomial function, and it's kind of easy to confuse it with $2.8a$:

​	$$\vec{x}_n(t)=\vec{a}_0+\vec{a}_1t+\vec{a}_2t^2+\vec{a}_3t^3+...+\vec{a}_nt^n \tag{2.8d}$$

The arrow over the variable name $x$, and the ones over the variable names $a_n$ signify that each variable is a vector.  You can't tell how many dimensions is in each vector from $2.8d$.  You have to get that information from somewhere else.

Another even more confusing notation you will sometimes see involves using a bold-face font for the variable name instead of using an arrow:

​	$$\mathbf{x}_n(t)=\mathbf{a}_0+\mathbf{a}_1t+\mathbf{a}_2t^2+\mathbf{a}_3t^3+...+\mathbf{a}_nt^n \tag{2.8e}$$

We won't use this notation, because it seems to us too easy to confuse with $2.8a$. 



**NOTE:**

In some texts, you may encounter yet another notation representing a 2D function like this:

​	$$f(x, y)(t)\tag{2.8d}$$

We won't use this notation, but you might see it in other documents.

You might also see the following notation for a 3D function:

​	$$f(x, y, z)(t)\tag{2.8f}$$

And this for a 4D function:

​	$$f(x, y, z, w)(t) \tag{2.8g}$$
